HELP = <<END
pro is a command to help you manage your git repositories.

Base Directory ==========
Pro works from a base directory for efficiency.
This is the folder that contains all your other git repositories;
they don't have to be at the base level, just somewhere down the tree.

To set the base directory set the PRO_BASE environment variable or make 
a ~/.proBase file containing the path.

Commands ===============
pro search <query> - prints path of git repo that matches query.
pro install - Install the pro cd command. cd to a directory by fuzzy git repo matching.
pro help - display help

CD Command ============
You can use the 'pro install' command to install a wrapper function that allows
you to cd to git repositories in your Pro Base wherever you are based on fuzzy matching.

Example:

  ~/randomFolder/ $ pd pro
  pro/ $ pwd 
  /Users/tristan/Box/Dev/Projects/pro

END

command = ARGV.shift || 'help'

case command
when 'search'
  puts Pro.find_repo(ARGV.first)
when 'install'
  Pro.install_cd
when 'status'
  Pro.status
when 'help'
  puts HELP 
end
